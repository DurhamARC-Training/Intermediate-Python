# Intermediate Python training course materials (WIP)

## Developer's guide

* Moved the old versions to the Archive folder
* Edited the title page for the 2023 spring training

The idea is to have slides for the course as well as exercises to execute them either from command line in the console (using, for example,  interactive `ipython` or `python` ==> needs to be installed on students' laptops) or in notebooks from browser (using, for example, Jupyter or Google Colab). We are in the beginning stage of planning our course, so we might end up with very different slides and exercises. Let's discuss what we want to teach and how!
